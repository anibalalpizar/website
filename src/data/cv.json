      "Starting my career in the frontend area. My passion for creating attractive and functional user interfaces led me to master technologies like React, Angular, Next.js, and Astro. Throughout this time, I have worked on a wide variety of projects, ranging from single-page web applications to more complex platforms that require a smooth and efficient user experience.",
      "After solidifying my skills in frontend development, I decided to expand my expertise to the backend to gain a deeper understanding of the full application development cycle. This decision was driven by the need to have more control over data flow and business logic in the applications I was building. I learned to work with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL, which allowed me to develop more robust and scalable applications.",
      "Finally, by combining my knowledge of frontend and backend, I perfected my skills as a Full Stack Developer. This evolution has enabled me to approach projects holistically, from designing the user interface to implementing business logic and managing databases. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn emerging technologies and share my knowledge with the community."
